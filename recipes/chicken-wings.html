    <p>This easy Chicken Wings recipe is a healthier and more flavorful way to cook your favorite appetizer recipe because they're baked instead of fried! A simple seasoning rub creates the best flavor and gives these oven-baked wings the crispiest skin. Make plenty, because they'll go fast-especially if you're making them for game day parties.</p>
