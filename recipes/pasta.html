    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Feta cheese</li>
        <li>Mezze rigatoni</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Toss the cherry tomatoes and olive oil with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl until combined. Place the feta in the center of the tomatoes and season with a pinch of black pepper. </li>
        <li>Bake until the tomatoes have burst and the feta has softened, about 30 minutes. Raise the heat to 450 degrees F and continue to cook until the tomatoes and feta are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 13 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then thoroughly drain the pasta. </li>
        <li>As soon as the tomatoes and feta come out of the oven, stir in the garlic and red pepper flakes. Smash the tomatoes and feta into a smooth and creamy sauce.</li> 
        <li>Add the pasta and half the basil and toss until evenly coated. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve topped with the remaining basil.</li>
    </ol>
